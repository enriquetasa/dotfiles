# dotfiles

these are the dotfiles I use.

the way this repository works is you read this file first, then you use the "macos.sh" or "linux.sh" files for setup depending on what OS the system you're trying to setup is on and they take care of everything. you then have the same experience across all your machines and everything works the way you want. if I need to change something for it to work, I modify this file, then re-run the setup files. rinse and repeat.
